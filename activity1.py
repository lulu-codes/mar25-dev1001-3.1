# 1.    Create a variable for your favorite number (can be a float like 7.5).
# 2.    Create a variable for your favorite food (a string).
# 3.    USE an f-string with print() to display a sentence like: "My favorite food is [YourFood] and my favorite number is [YourNumber]."
# 4.    If your number was a float, try printing it again using an f-string, but format it to display with only one decimal place (e.g., :.1f).

favorite_number = 8
favorite_food = "salmon"

print(f"My favorite food is {favorite_food} and my favorite number is {favorite_number}.")
